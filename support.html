          This year Seattle Pacific University is excited to give students the opportunity to be involved in Baja SAE for the first time. Since we are a first year team, we are taking this year to focus on designing the car and prototyping where applicable. This
          year, we have a team of about 15 to 20 students coming together to design and build an off-road vehicle that will survive rough terrain. And next year, we hope to compete in the Baja SAE competition for the first time in SPU history. </p>
        <p>Our team is comprised of students from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Business. We come together to create a professional environment in which this project can be completed. Seattle Pacific University’s Baja
          SAE students gain experience in design, documentation, machining, assembly, product testing, as well as budgeting and purchasing. For participating in Baja SAE, our students develop the necessary skills needed in future employment. </p>
        <p>One of our priorities as a team is to build a sponsorship network. As you can imagine, designing and building a Baja SAE car, then competing at the national level requires generous donations from a multitude of companies. Without these donations,
          we understand that there could not be a Baja SAE program at SPU. </p>
        <p>In return for donations, our sponsors will receive advertising space on our cars, website and t-shirts. Levels of advertisement will depend on the donation value. Also, we operate through Seattle Pacific University’s mechanical engineering department
          (a 501c3 organization) so the value of the donation is tax deductible. We can also handle special requests such as photos for company websites, etc.
